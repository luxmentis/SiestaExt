# Siesta + SwiftUI Example App

This is a SwiftUI version of the original UIKit Siesta sample app from the
Siesta repo, and demonstrates how to use the SwiftUI aspects of this library.

If you're coming from Siesta + UIKit (or AppKit), comparing this app with the
original might help convince you to adopt SwiftUI! There's certanly less code.

The GithubAPI class is mostly the same as the original, except modified to
return typed resources (see the main README). 

The README from the original example has lots of useful explanation, which applies
here too, so you could read that.
